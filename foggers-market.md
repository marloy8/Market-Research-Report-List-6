<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Foggers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Foggers</li><li>Cold Foggers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Foggers are essential tools used for pest control, sanitation, and disinfection. The market is primarily divided into two types: thermal foggers and cold foggers. Thermal foggers utilize heat to vaporize insecticides, creating a dense fog that penetrates hard-to-reach areas, making them effective for outdoor applications. Cold foggers, on the other hand, use a mechanical process to disperse liquid insecticides without heating, resulting in a finer mist suitable for indoor use and sensitive environments. Both types serve distinct purposes in pest management.</p></p>
