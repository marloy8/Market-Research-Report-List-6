<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMP Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hard CMP Pads</li><li>Soft CMP Pads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CMP pads are essential in semiconductor manufacturing for chemical mechanical polishing. Hard CMP pads are rigid and provide precise control over planarization, making them ideal for polishing difficult materials like silicon dioxide and metals. They deliver a consistent removal rate but can result in higher wear. In contrast, soft CMP pads are more flexible, allowing for better conformability to wafer surfaces, which enhances surface quality. They are typically used for softer materials, providing a gentler polish with minimal defects.</p></p>
