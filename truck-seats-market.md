<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck Seats Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Suspension Truck Seats</li><li>Mechanical Suspension Truck Seats</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The truck seats market comprises two primary types: air suspension and mechanical suspension seats. Air suspension truck seats utilize an air-filled bladder system to absorb shocks and vibrations, providing a smoother and more comfortable ride, particularly on rough terrains. In contrast, mechanical suspension truck seats rely on springs and dampers to reduce impact. While typically less expensive, they may not offer the same level of comfort as air suspension options. Both types cater to different preferences for ride quality and cost-effectiveness in commercial transport.</p></p>
