<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cathodic Protection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Galvanic</li><li>Impressed Current</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cathodic Protection Systems (CPS) are used to prevent corrosion in metal structures by applying a protective electrical current. The market can be divided into two main types: Galvanic and Impressed Current systems. Galvanic systems use sacrificial anodes made of more reactive metals that corrode instead of the protected structure. In contrast, Impressed Current systems utilize an external power source to drive a protective current, making them suitable for large structures and environments with high corrosion rates. Both systems are critical for extending asset life.</p></p>
