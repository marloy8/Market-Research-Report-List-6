<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicle Airbag Inflator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pyrotechnic Inflator</li><li>Stored Gas Inflator</li><li>Hybrid Inflator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Electric Vehicle Airbag Inflator market encompasses three main types: pyrotechnic inflators, stored gas inflators, and hybrid inflators. Pyrotechnic inflators utilize combustion to generate gas rapidly, providing quick deployment during a collision. Stored gas inflators pre-fill a gas container that can be released on impact, ensuring a controlled inflation rate. Hybrid inflators combine both methods, delivering gas both from a pyrotechnic reaction and stored reserves, optimizing deployment speed and inflation consistency for enhanced passenger safety in electric vehicles.</p></p>
