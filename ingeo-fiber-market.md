<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ingeo Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Spinning</li><li>Melt Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ingeo Fiber market primarily consists of two main types: solution spinning and melt spinning. Solution spinning involves dissolving polylactic acid (PLA) in a solvent to create a viscous solution that is then extruded to form fibers. This method is suitable for achieving high-quality, fine fibers. In contrast, melt spinning processes PLA in a molten state, extruding it through spinnerets to produce fibers. Melt spinning is generally more efficient for bulk production but may yield slightly lower quality fibers compared to solution spinning.</p></p>
