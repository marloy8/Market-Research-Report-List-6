<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rodenticide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anticoagulants Rodenticides</li><li>Non-anticoagulants Rodenticides</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rodenticide market is primarily divided into two types: anticoagulants and non-anticoagulants. Anticoagulant rodenticides function by disrupting the blood clotting process, leading to internal bleeding in rodents, making them effective for long-term control. In contrast, non-anticoagulants act through various mechanisms, such as neurotoxicity or metabolic disruption, providing quicker results but often requiring multiple doses. Both types are crucial for managing rodent populations in agricultural, residential, and commercial settings, contributing to pest management strategies worldwide.</p></p>
