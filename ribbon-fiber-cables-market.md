<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ribbon Fiber Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mode</li><li>Multi-Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ribbon fiber cables are categorized into two main types: single-mode and multi-mode. Single-mode cables contain a single light path, allowing for longer transmission distances and higher data rates, making them ideal for telecommunications and long-haul applications. Multi-mode cables, on the other hand, have multiple light paths, which support shorter distances and are typically used in local area networks (LANs) and data centers. Each type serves distinct purposes based on bandwidth requirements and distance considerations in various networking environments.</p></p>
