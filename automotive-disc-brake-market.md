<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Disc Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Opposed Piston</li><li>Floating Caliper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive disc brake market features primarily two types: opposed piston and floating caliper designs. Opposed piston brakes utilize pistons on either side of the disc, enhancing braking force and responsiveness while evenly distributing pressure. In contrast, floating caliper brakes have a single piston that pushes the caliper toward the disc, allowing for a lighter design and easier installation. Both types ensure effective stopping power, catering to various vehicle applications and preferences in performance and maintenance.</p></p>
