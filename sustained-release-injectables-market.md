<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sustained Release Injectables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Microparticles</li><li>Implants</li><li>Gels</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sustained release injectables market encompasses three primary types: microparticles, implants, and gels. Microparticles are small carriers that encapsulate active ingredients, allowing for gradual drug release over time. Implants are solid or semi-solid devices placed in the body that release medication steadily, often for extended periods. Gels are viscous substances that can encapsulate drugs, providing controlled release through diffusion or erosion. These forms enhance therapeutic efficacy by maintaining drug levels in the bloodstream and reducing dosing frequency.</p></p>
